/**
 * <p>{@code Template Method} is to create a method stub and deferring some
 * of the steps of implementation to the subclasses. Template method defines
 * the steps to execute an algorithm and it can provide default implementation
 * that might be common for all or some of the subclasses.
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Template method should consists of certain steps whose order is fixed
 *     and for some of the methods, implementation differs from base class to subclass.
 *     Template method should be final.</li>
 *     <li>Most of the times, subclasses calls methods from super class but in template
 *     pattern, superclass template method calls methods from subclasses</li>
 *     <li>Methods in base class with default implementation are referred as Hooks and
 *     they are intended to be overridden by subclasses, if you want some of the methods
 *     to be not overridden, you can make them final, for example in our case we can make
 *     buildFoundation() method final because if we donâ€™t want subclasses to override it.</li>
 * </ul>
