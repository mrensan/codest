/**
 * There are three major issues with Factory and Abstract Factory
 * design patterns when the Object contains a lot of attributes.
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Too Many arguments to pass from client program to the
 *     Factory class that can be error prone because most of the time,
 *     the type of arguments are same and from client side itâ€™s hard to
 *     maintain the order of the argument.</li>
 *     <li>Some of the parameters might be optional but in Factory pattern,
 *     we are forced to send all the parameters and optional parameters
 *     need to send as NULL.</li>
 *     <li>If the object is heavy and its creation is complex, then all that
 *     complexity will be part of Factory classes that is confusing.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Builder Pattern Implementation:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>First of all you need to create a static nested class and then copy
 *     all the arguments from the outer class to the Builder class. We should
 *     follow the naming convention and if the class name is Computer then builder
 *     class should be named as ComputerBuilder.</li>
 *     <li>The Builder class should have a public constructor with all the
 *     required attributes as parameters.</li>
 *     <li>Builder class should have methods to set the optional parameters and
 *     it should return the same Builder object after setting the optional attribute.</li>
 *     <li>The final step is to provide a build() method in the builder class that
 *     will return the Object needed by client program. For this we need to have
 *     a private constructor in the Class with Builder class as argument.</li>
 * </ul>
