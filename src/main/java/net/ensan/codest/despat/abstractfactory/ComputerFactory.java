/**
 * <p>Abstract Factory is one of the Creational pattern and almost similar to
 * Factory Pattern except the fact that itâ€™s more like factory of factories.
 *
 * <p>In Abstract Factory pattern, we get rid of if-else block and have a
 * factory class for each sub-class and then an Abstract Factory class that
 * will return the sub-class based on the input factory class.
 *
 * <p>Abstract Factory pattern is robust and avoid conditional logic of Factory pattern.
